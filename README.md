# IoT-Based Smart Dehydration System for Grapes-to-Raisins Conversion

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and developing an IoT-enabled smart dehydration system that automates the traditional grapes-to-raisins conversion process. The system provides controlled temperature, humidity regulation, and real-time monitoring to ensure consistent, high-quality raisin production with minimal human intervention.

By integrating sensors, actuators, and IoT connectivity, the system optimizes drying conditions and prevents over-drying, spoilage, or nutrient loss.

## 🚀 **Working Principle**
1. Fresh grapes are placed inside the dehydration chamber.  
2. Sensors continuously monitor temperature and humidity.  
3. Microcontroller processes sensor data and automatically controls:
   - Heating element  
   - Exhaust fan  
4. IoT dashboard displays real-time values and system status.  
5. Users can monitor the drying progress remotely.  
6. Grapes slowly lose moisture under controlled conditions and convert into raisins.
